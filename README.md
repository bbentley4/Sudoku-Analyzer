# Sudoku-Analyzer

Inspired by the Silly Sudoku Top Coder problem. The aim is not to re-invent backtracking algorithms, but rather investigate how varying board sizes influence execution time and the number of solutions generated.

# BackTracking

The algorithm for backtracking was the same one used in the TopCoder solution, [found here](https://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=match_editorials&d2=srm315). I adjusted the code to work in C++.
